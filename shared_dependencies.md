The shared dependencies between the files "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css" for a simple personal website using Tailwind UI for styling are:

1. **HTML Elements**: The "index.html" file will contain all the HTML elements that make up the structure of the website. These elements will have unique id names that can be used by CSS for styling. For example, ids like "header", "main", "footer" could be used to style the header, main content, and footer sections of the website respectively.

2. **CSS Classes**: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will contain CSS classes that are used to style the HTML elements. These classes will be shared between the HTML and CSS files. For example, classes like ".container", ".text-center", ".bg-white" could be used to style the container, center the text, and set the background color to white respectively.

3. **Tailwind UI Components**: The "tailwind.css" file will contain the Tailwind UI components that are used for styling. These components will be shared between the HTML and CSS files. For example, components like "navbar", "card", "button" could be used to style the navigation bar, cards, and buttons respectively.

4. **Media Queries**: The "styles.css" file will contain media queries that are used to make the website responsive. These media queries will be shared between the HTML and CSS files. For example, media queries like "@media (min-width: 640px)", "@media (min-width: 768px)", "@media (min-width: 1024px)" could be used to style the website for different screen sizes.

5. **Link to CSS Files**: The "index.html" file will contain links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. These links will be shared between the HTML and CSS files. For example, links like "<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">", "<link rel="stylesheet" href="tailwind.css">" will be used to link the CSS files to the HTML file.
